#Aliases for really common commands to cut down annoying command structure and extra typing.
#alias tmux="tmux -2"       #Forces tmux to assume a 256 color terminal (This makes tmux play nice with all my custom colors)
    #don't need this with msys2, this was apparently an issue with putty?
alias ls="ls -G"    #Shows off fun color scheme and makes information a little more at-a-glance.
alias ll="ls -alhG"
alias lsd="ls -AlhRR"     #Deep ls, does recursive listing, shows hidden files, human readable sizes.
alias t="task"          #This is a todo list/task manager that I'm trying out, so far it's very good.
